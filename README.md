This is a bot that we created to handle automated shopping on ecommerce websites. We currently support BestBuy and Walmart.

To use, copy the 'config-template.py' file, rename it 'config.py', and fill in the information.

Then, run the script as follows:

```
python shopper.py [-h] [-d delay] [-n number] url
```
